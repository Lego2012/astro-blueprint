And here's a call example in the footer:

~~~html
<div className='flex items-center gap-5 mt-8'>
    <!-- Simple loop for icons  -->
    {socialMedia.map((icon) => (
        <div
        className='flex justify-center items-center w-12 h-12 bg-white rounded-full'
        key={icon.alt}
        >
            <img src={icon.src} alt={icon.alt} width={24} height={24} />
        </div>
    ))}
</div>

<div className='flex flex-1 justify-between lg:gap-10 gap-20 flex-wrap'>
    <!-- Outer loop for name  -->
    {footerLinks.map((section) => (
        <div key={section.title}>
            <h4 className='font-montserrat text-2xl leading-normal font-medium mb-6 text-white'>
                {section.title}
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <!-- Inner loop for links  -->
                {section.links.map((link) => (
                    <li
                    className='mt-3 font-montserrat text-base leading-normal text-white-400 hover:text-slate-gray'
                    key={link.name}
                    >
                        <a href={link.link}>{link.name}</a>
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    ))}
</div>
